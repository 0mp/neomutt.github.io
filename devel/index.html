<h1>Development</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">What's Going On?</h2>

<h2>Current Development</h2>

<p>
  The development is done in <a href="https://github.com/neomutt/flatcap">FlatCap's repo</a>
  To understand the layout, this <a href="https://flatcap.org/mutt/flatcap.png">Repository Diagram</a>
  may help.  Key: Red = Mutt, Green = Sidebar, Light Blue = NotMuch, Yellow =
  Releases.  The collection of icons shows which <a href="/features.html">Features</a>
  were merged and in which order.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Note:</b> This repository is under <b>heavy</b> development and anything you see
  today, may be gone _later_ today.
</p>

<p>
  There are more development pages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="status.html">Status</a> - The status of each of the features, with links to the source and diffs
  <li><a href="github.html">GitHub</a> - Descriptions of all the NeoMutt repositories and how the branches fit together
  <li><a href="coding.html">Coding Style</a> - The preferred style for code committed to NeoMutt
  <li><a href="tasks.html">Tasks</a> - A list of tasks to be done
  <li><a href="obsolescence.html">Obsolescence</a> - A list of old projects that can be forgotten
</ul>

<p>
  Finally, some automatic checking is done on commits and pull-requests for
  NeoMutt.  It benefits from two free services (free for Open Source).  They are
  triggered on every commit to GitHub.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://travis-ci.com/">Travis CI</a> automatically build projects on every commit (Continuous Integration).
  <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/">Coverity</a> performs static analysis on the code looking for potential problems.

<p>
  NeoMutt also has a couple of speculative ideas:
  <ul>
    <li>Redesigning Mutt's [architecture](https://github.com/neomutt/arch#arch)</li>
    <li>Redesigning Mutt's [gui](https://github.com/neomutt/panel-manager#panel-manager)</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Note:</b> These are just toys (for now).
