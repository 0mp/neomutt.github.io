<h1>GitHub Repositories</h1>

<p>
For now, NeoMutt is only available in source form and all the important code is
in the <a href="https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt">neomutt repo</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Each feature has its own branch in the repo.  Any changes to features happen
  there.  This means each can be cleanly merged into Mutt.
</p>

<p>
  The NeoMutt branch is mostly merge commits from the feature branches.  It also
  contains commits that aren't appropriate to merge into Mutt, such as changing
  the version number.
</p>

<p>
  This diagram shows how the branches fit togethers.  For historic reasons, the
  features are split into the “minors” and “extras” that are merged before and
  after the NotMuch branch, respectively.
