<h1>GitHub Repositories</h1>

<p>
  All the source code for NeoMutt, and its patches, is available on GitHub.
  The majority is in the
  <a href="https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt">neomutt repo</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Each feature has its own branch in the repo.  Any changes to features happen
  there.  This means each can be cleanly merged into Mutt.
</p>

<p>
  The NeoMutt branch is mostly merge commits from the feature branches.  It also
  contains commits that aren't appropriate to merge into Mutt, such as changing
  the version number.
</p>

<p>
  This diagram shows how the branches fit together.  The features are separate
  streams starting from Mutt-1.6.2.  Changes are merged into the NeoMutt branch.
</p>

<p>
  Some distros have a rolling release which picks up these "Hot Fixes"
  (H<sub>1</sub>, H<sub>2</sub> on the diagram).
</p>

<p>
  Periodically, about every month, a new release of NeoMutt is made
  (R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub> on the diagram).
</p>
