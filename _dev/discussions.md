NeoMutt is very popular and its users come up with lots of great new ideas.

Unfortunately NeoMutt's development team is quite small, so they can't implement everything.

Below is a list of the issues that the developers can't help with.

They are closed for now, but they can be re-opened if someone volunteers to do the work.
Help will be freely given to volunteers.
