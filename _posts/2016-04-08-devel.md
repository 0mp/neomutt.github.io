title: Devel -- Reorganisation of Branches
---

NeoMutt is starting to get quite large.  With Mutt's latest release there are
now two of all the branches.

Most branch names are composed of a category and name, e.g. "feature/sidebar".
Categories ending in '5' are for the 1.5 branch of Mutt (the old version).

**Categories:**

- mutt -- Official Mutt releases
- neomutt, neomutt5 -- Release branches for NeoMutt
- feature, feature5 -- Individual features
- devel -- Development, Features not ready for release
- issue -- Bug fixes for issues

**Note:** The issue branches are temporary work areas whilst a bug is being
fixed.  Once fixed, the changes will be added to the relevant feature.
