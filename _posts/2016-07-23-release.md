# Feature Release

## New Motto

### NeoMutt - "Teaching an Old Dog New Tricks"

It's very appropriate, it's catchy, it's funny.
Thank you [Alok Singh](https://github.com/Alok) for the suggestion.

## Important Changes

### Sidebar

The Sidebar has been accepted into Mutt and has undergone some changes in the process.  The default `sidebar_format` has changed to display only 'N' for new mail.  If you want the old behaviour, please set this config:

```
set sidebar_format = "%B%?F? [%F]?%* %?N?%N/?%S"
set mail_check_stats = yes
```

Also note that `$sidebar_refresh` has been dropped.  It is no longer needed and it was misleading when it was.

## New Features
  - [**New Mail Command**](http://www.neomutt.org/feature/new-mail/) - Execute a command on receipt of new mail
  - [**vim-keybindings**](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/tree/contrib/vim-keybindings) - Mutt config for vim users
