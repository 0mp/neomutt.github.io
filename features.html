<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
  NeoMutt has brought together lots of Mutt patches, many of which were useful,
  but had been abandoned.
</p>

<p>Before each patch is marked stable:
<ul>
  <li>The code is brought up-to-date with Mutt-1.5.24</li>
  <li>The code is tidied up, comments added, checks done</li>
  <li>Documentation is written</li>
  <li>A sample muttrc is created</li>
  <li>The feature is tested</li>
</ul>
